Welcome to [**Goodie Forms**](https://github.com/iGoodie/goodie-forms), an unopinionated modern form state and data management library.

## What is Goodie Forms?

**Goodie Forms** provides type-safe and feature-rich pieces to help you build a seamless form experience.
It is built from ground up, with a concern of DX (Developer Experience) in mind.

It is enriched and generified using these:

## Key Features

<!-- This theme includes a range of features designed to improve documentation management: -->

- **Framework-agnostic core**: Designed to work with any UI layer (React, Vue, Solid, or vanilla).
- **Fully type-safe**: Built with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) from the ground up. Deep type inference ensures form values, errors, and validation are correctly typed at every level.
- **Validation library agnostic**: Thanks to [Standard Schema V1](https://standardschema.dev/), you can plug in popular libraries like Zod, Valibot, Yup, or your own validation logic without being locked into a single solution.
- **Fine-grained control over state**: Track touched, dirty, validating, and error states per field or per form.
- **Optimized for DX**: Clear APIs, strong IntelliSense support, and predictable behavior reduce cognitive load during development.
- **Unopinionated by default**: No forced UI components. No design constraints. Goodie Forms handles logic — you handle presentation.
